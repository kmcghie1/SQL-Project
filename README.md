# SQL-Project
A repository made to store related files for my SQL Project.

For a single week at Sparta Global, we were taught SQL (Structured Query Language) using Azure Data Studios. We were given access to a database 'Northwind' which had multiple tables that all related to each other. 

Nearing the end of this week, we were assigned a project which included a list of questions that asked for specific information from those tables on the Northwind database. In this specific project, the goal was to correctly implement a variety of different orders through the use of SQL querying.

This project tested my abilities to access, and also navigate, through multiple tables to retrieve data and then connect that data to related data in other tables.
As a result, I made use of SQL Commands, specifically DML (Data Manipulation Language) and DDL (Data Definition Language). This included: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP and TRUNCATE. 

My knowledge on JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, etc.) was also tested.

In addition to JOINS, I also applied knowledge on various aggregate functions (SUM, AVG) and answered questions that required grouping and ordering (GROUP BY, ORDER BY).

However, other than using SQL, I also utilised spreadsheet software (Microsoft Excel).

There were times when I would import the table data, extracted from one or more tables from the database using queries, into a spreadsheet in order to convert that data into a graph, to be visually analysed.

Included is a .PDF file that contains the questions, my own answers, as well as the tables and charts that were built based on my query answers.
