# SQL-Project
A repository made to store related files for my SQL Project.

In this specific project, the goal was to correctly implement a variety of different orders through the use of SQL querying.

This project tested my abilities to access, and also navigate, through multiple tables to retrieve data and then connect that data to related data in other tables.
As a result, my knowledge on JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, etc.) was tested.

In addition to JOINS, I also applied knowledge on various aggregate functions (SUM, AVG) and answered questions that required grouping and ordering (GROUP BY, ORDER BY).

However, other than using SQL, I also utilised spreadsheet software (Microsoft Excel).
There were times when I would import the table data, extracted from one or more tables from the database using queries, into a spreadsheet in order to convert that data into a graph, to be visually analysed.
